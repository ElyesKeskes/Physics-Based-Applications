# Unity Physics Simulation - Rigidbody and Spring System

This project demonstrates a physics simulation in Unity using Rigidbody and Spring systems. The focus of this simulation is to showcase how forces are applied to a spring, demonstrating the interaction between Rigidbody components and spring forces within a 3D environment.

## Project Overview

The simulation involves a Rigidbody object attached to a spring that responds to applied forces. The spring behaves according to Hooke's law, with forces exerted based on its displacement, and forces like damping and tension are implemented to control the spring's motion.

## My Role

My primary responsibility in this project was to develop the spring system and implement the logic for applying forces to it. This includes:

- **Spring System Development**: Implementing a spring component that calculates the forces acting on a Rigidbody based on its position relative to the spring's resting state.
- **Force Application**: Creating and applying forces to the spring and connected Rigidbody, including restoring forces (Hooke's law), damping forces, and tension.

## Features

- **Spring Force**: The spring exerts force based on displacement from its resting position (Hooke's law).
- **Damping**: A damping force is applied to simulate friction or resistance that gradually slows the movement.
- **Force Interaction**: Forces like tension and external forces can be applied to simulate different real-world scenarios.

## How to Use

1. **Clone this Repository**
2. **Open in Unity**:
Open the project in Unity and navigate to the scene containing the spring and Rigidbody components.

3. **Play the Simulation**:
Press the "Play" button in Unity's editor to start the simulation. You should see the Rigidbody attached to the spring, which will respond to applied forces.

4. **Adjust Parameters**:
You can adjust parameters like spring constant, damping factor, and force values in the Unity Inspector to see how they affect the simulation.

## Technologies Used

- **Unity**: Game engine used to create the simulation.
- **C#**: Scripting language for developing the spring logic and force application.
